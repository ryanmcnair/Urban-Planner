# Urban-Planner

In this exercise, you are going to define your own **`Building`** type and create several instances of it to design your own virtual city. Create a class named **`Building`** in the `Building.cs` file and define the following fields, properties, and methods.

Also make sure that the class is defined in the same namespace as your program.

```csharp
namespace Planner{    
	// Define class here
}
```

### Private Fields

- `_designer` of type `string`. It will hold your name.
- `_dateConstructed` of type `DateTime`. This will hold the exact time the building was created.
- `_address` of type string.
- `_owner` of type string. This will store the name of the person who owns the building.

### Public Properties

- `Stories` typed as an integer.
- `Width` typed as a double.
- `Depth` typed as a double.
- `Volume` should be read-only and should return *width * depth * (3 * # of stories)*. Each story is 3 meters high.

### Constructor

Define a constructor method that accepts a single string argument - `address` - so that you can send as a parameter when you create each instance with `new Building("800 8th Street");`.

- The constructor’s logic should set the `_address` field’s value to the argument value

### Public Methods

- Define a `Construct()` method. The method’s logic should set the `_dateConstructed` field’s value to `DateTime.Now`.
- Define a `Purchase()` method. The method should accept a single string argument of the name of the person purchasing a building. The method should take that string and assign it to the private `_owner` field.

Neither of these methods will return a value.

### Build Your City

1. Create several buildings in the `Main()` method of `Program.cs`.

    ```csharp
    Building FiveOneTwoEigth = new Building("512 8th Avenue");
    ```

2. Give each building a width, height, and number of stories.
3. Construct each building.
4. Have business people in your city purchase each of your buildings.

After all of the buildings have been purchased, display the following information to the console for each building.

```bash
100 Main Street---------------
Designed by Steve Brownlee
Constructed on 2/1/18 7:19:08 AM
Owned by Bob Ross
16128 cubic meters of space
```
